## iRODS Python based portal

### Technical:
- backend framework: Flask
- frontend framework: Vue.js (but not too much)
- code organisation: Flask blueprints for making things modular
- leverage the irods-Python client
- if available and desirable, talk directly to Elastic search to speed up some queries and to leverage all the Lucene search goodies
- uses its own (MySQL) database to store sessions and possibly non irods data
